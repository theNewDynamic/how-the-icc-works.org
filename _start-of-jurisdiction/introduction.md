Whether *after* or *during* the commission of alleged atrocity crimes, the ICC can *only&nbsp;*exercise jurisdiction over such crimes in one of three ways:

* Where a State Party refers the crimes to the Court (State Party Referral),
* Where the UN Security Council refers the crimes to the Court (UN Security Council Referral), or
* Where the ICC Prosecutor initiates a preliminary examination into the crimes (*Propio Motu* Investigations).
