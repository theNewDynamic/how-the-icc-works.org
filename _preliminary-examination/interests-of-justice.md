Even when the jurisdictional and admissibility requirements are met, the Prosecutor has the discretion to determine whether moving a case forward at the ICC serves the “interests of justice.” The Prosecutor may decide not to move forward with an investigation or prosecution if she decides that there are substantial reasons to believe that this is not in the interests of justice. A Pre-Trial Chamber can review this decision.
