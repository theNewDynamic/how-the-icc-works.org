Even when the temporal, subject matter, and personal jurisdictional requirements are satisfied, the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf) limits the types of cases that “admissible” at the ICC. The ICC Prosecutor must determine whether another court (domestic or international) is properly investigating and prosecuting the alleged crimes (this concept is called “complementarity”), and whether the alleged crimes are the gravest of crimes (this concept is called "gravity").
