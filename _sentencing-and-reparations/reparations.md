If the Trial Chamber (TC) convicts the Accused, it may also order reparations for victims for the harm suffered. Reparations can only be ordered for those crimes for which the Accused has been convicted. Reparations can be awarded to individuals and/or collective entities.&nbsp; Reparations can take multiple forms, including rehabilitation, compensation, and restitution. The TC can order either the convicted person and/or the ICC Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) to pay monetary compensation.&nbsp;

The Office of the Prosecutor, the convicted person, or the victims can appeal the TC's order for reparations. The Appeals Chamber can uphold, reverse, or amend the reparations.

&nbsp;Thomas Lubanga Dylio was found guilty of the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 years and using them to participate actively in hostilities in 2012. This was the first ICC conviction. On 3 March 2015, the Appeals Chamber instructed the Trust Fund for Victims to draft a plan for the issuance of collective reparations for the victims involved.
