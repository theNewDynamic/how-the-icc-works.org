The Prosecutor may start a preliminary investigation&nbsp;*proprio motu*&nbsp;(“on one’s own initiative” in Latin), into alleged atrocity crimes that have occurred either:

* on the territory, or by a national, of any State Party; or
* on the territory, or by a national, of a non-State Party that has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction temporarily.

The Prosecutor must receive approval from judges in order to open a formal investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;
