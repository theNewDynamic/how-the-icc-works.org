The UN Security Council (UNSC) may refer alleged atrocities in any country to the Prosecutor by passing a resolution authorized by the UN Charter.

In March 2005, the UNSC referred the situation in Darfur, Sudan, to the ICC.&nbsp;

In February 2011, the UNSC referred the situation in Libya to the ICC.

Where a permanent member of the UNSC vetoes the referral of a country to the ICC, the ICC cannot investigate. The permanent members of the UNSC are China, France, Russia, the USA, and the UK. In May 2014, Russia and China vetoed the referral of the situation in Syria to the ICC.
