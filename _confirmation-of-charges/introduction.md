After an individual’s initial appearance, the Pre-Trial Chamber (PTC) must hold a hearing within a reasonable amount of time to confirm or dismiss the charges presented by the Prosecutor. The PTC can either:

* Confirm the charges and send the case to the Trial Chambers for trial (at this point the individual becomes the “Accused”); or
* Dismiss the charges and set the individual free; or
* Pause the hearing to request the Prosecutor to produce additional evidence or change the charges with the evidence presented.

If charges are dismissed, the ICC Prosecutor can provide additional evidence at a later time in order to convince the PTC to confirm the original charges. &nbsp;Alternatively, the ICC Prosecutor can start the whole process over again with different charges.
